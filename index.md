## About me


I am an experienced IT professional transitioning to a career in Data Science.  I have an undergraduate degree in Finance from The University of Iowa and a Masters Degree in Data Science from Bellevue University.

Throughout my career, I have worked in various IT roles, primarily in Quality Assurance, but also in Business Analysis and Development.  In my current role as a Quality Assurance Analyst, I validate that our accounting and reporting applications are functioning as expected and returning accurate results. This involves a lot of database querying and updating test data as well as a great deal of API testing.  This has encouraged my passion for data and my desire to work more in depth with the data, analyze it and extract knowledge and insights from it.
