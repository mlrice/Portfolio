## About me

I am an experienced IT professional transitioning to a career in Data Science.  I have an undergraduate degree in Finance from The University of Iowa and a Masters Degree in Data Science from Bellevue University.

Throughout my career, I have worked in various IT roles, primarily in Quality Assurance, but also in Business Analysis and Development.  In my current role as a Quality Assurance Analyst, I validate that our accounting and reporting applications are functioning as expected and returning accurate results. This involves a lot of database querying and updating test data as well as a great deal of API testing.  This has encouraged my passion for data and my desire to work more in depth with the data, analyze it and extract knowledge and insights from it.

        An essential part of retail success is understanding the customer.  Not only knowing what their demographic details are, but what their specific shopping habits are and how to capitalize on that. Customer segmentation allows us to put similar customers into groups and market to them based on their characteristics in order to maximize the value of each customer.  This project uses a dataset from Instacart and analyzes customer purchases over time to determine how recently they have shopped, how frequently they shop and how much they buy and then places the customer into segments. </p><br>

          Accurately predicting sales and inventory is especially important for grocery stores since they are dealing with perishable items.  Additionally, not placing or pricing items appropriately could cause lost sales. This project addresses how we can determine what products are frequently purchased together so that we can market them together, plan the most beneficial store placement of products and plan pricing in order to encourage customers to purchase additional products.

      <p>
          Employee turnover is very costly to an organization. In order to reduce the amount of turnover, we must understand why employees are leaving.  This project looks at employee turnover and attempts to identify variables that contribute most to employees making the decision to leave their job.</p><br>

      <p>
          A common response when asking someone how they are, is "tired."  Are we not getting enough sleep?  Are there other factors that make us feel more or less tired, like whether we ate breakfast that day or had screen time right before bed?  This is a study of how much sleep is considered enough for people to not feel tired and what other factors might contribute to how tired they rate themselves. </p><br>

          This study uses a Kaggle dataset of alcohol consumption around the world and compares the amount consumed in various regions and countries.  It also considers what types of alcohol are consumed more in various areas and analyzes whethere there is a link between happiness scores and alcohol consumption. </p><br>

      <p>
         While the disparity in earnings for men and women has been reduced, it does still exist. In this project, I look at the gap in income for men and women and how it has changed and whether ethnicity plays a part in that gap as well.</p><br>

      <p>
          Professional baseball teams play a lot of games and in order to keep people coming, teams often use special promotions such as giveaways or events like fireworks.  This project looks at a dataset from a Dodgers season to determine what factors contributed to higher attendance and then make a recommendation for which promotions should be used on which days.  </p><br>

         Does income influence educational attainment?  In this project, I look at data provided by the USDA and determine whether educational attainment can be predicted based on income.  <br><br><br><br></p>
